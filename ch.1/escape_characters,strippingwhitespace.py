#this is how you include escape characters in your code, as well as indentation(tabs)
# Below is an example of the new line escape
print("Languages:\n Python \n C++ \n Javascript")
# Below this line is an example of the tab feature to indent the output 
print("\t Javascript")

#-------------------------------------------------

# Stripping white space from either side of the output

first_name = " Jake"
print(first_name)

# Now stripped from the left side

print(first_name.lstrip())

# Same goes for either or both sides of the variable.
